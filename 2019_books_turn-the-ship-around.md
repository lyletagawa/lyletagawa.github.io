## Turn the Ship Around! by L. David Marquet

First, though I liked the idea of empowerment, I didn't understand why empowerment was needed.

Second, the way I was told to manage others was not the way I wanted to be managed.

Third, I was disturbed by the close coupling of the technical competence of the leader with the performance of the organization.

One of the things that limit our learning is our belief that we already know something.

Simply exhorting people to be proactive, take ownership, be involved, and all the other aspects of an empowerment program just scratched the surface.

It is precisely the success of the top-down, leader-follower structure that makes it so appealing. As long as you are measuring performance over just the short run, it can be effective. Officers are rewarded for being indispensable, for being missed after they depart. When the performance of a unit goes down after an officer leaves, it is taken as a sign that he was a good leader, not that he was ineffective in training his people properly.

Are you curious? I thought I was being curious during my previous tours; turns out I was only "questioning."

Are you asking questions to make sure you know or to make sure they know?
