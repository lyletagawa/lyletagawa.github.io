<ul>
<li>What did you think of the web back then (1995)?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to be lucky than good. The commercial Internet really took off in the beginning of 1995 with Netscape. And, then Yahoo! followed quickly thereafter.</p>
<ul>
<li>How big was the fund back in those days?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our first fund was only 85 million dollars. It was the smallest fund in terms of dollars per partners. There were 5 of us in the top firms. We purposely capped the amount of money we were going to manage, in order to multiple the money more. In return, we wanted a higher percentage of the profits. That was very controversial at the time. Our first fund was a 65x fund.</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies at this time had larger capital requirements to get off the ground. is that true?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a misperception. Every industry when it gets started, has very modest capital requirements. As the industry or market matures that you need more capital to gain an advantage. I think this whole point about Internet companies requiring less money than other companies is not true at all. Lotus got started on a couple of hundred of thousand dollars. Microsoft got started on even less.</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the common traits that reoccur?</li>
</ul>
<p>Most important one &ndash; they were able to observe an inflection point in technology that allowed them to build a new kind of product. That&rsquo;s the exact opposite of most books on entrepreneurship: to look at a market, try to find a problem, and develop a solution. That leads to really mundane outcomes.</p>
<p>If you want to build a really big company, you have to do the opposite. You have to start with the inflection point in technology, take advantage of that inflection point to build a product, then find a market that wants the product. Start with a product, look for the market. It&rsquo;s higher risk and higher return.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you decide to do an investment?</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only must the opportunity be big, you need an unfair advantage. Otherwise, why are you going to be the winner vs someone else?</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you see yourself still growing as an enterpreneur?</li>
</ul>
<p>Successful individuals are incredibly intellectually curious and built to learn. Some people think they know it all already, and they tend not to improve at a rapid rate and they tend not to do as well. For the last 15 years I&rsquo;ve been teaching Technology Enterpreneurship courses at Stanford Graduate School of Businesss &ndash; My parting advice to my students in every class: if there&rsquo;s one thing you can do: keep on learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you hire?</li>
</ul>
<p>I prioritize passion over talent, if they have enough talent. This person who is passionate about the opportunity is likely to invest more time learning. They are likely to grow at a much faster pace. They may be less capable, but if they&rsquo;re more passionate, they will typically pass that person.</p>
<p>I can tell more from the questions the candidate asks me. You can tell when somebody cares, because they&rsquo;ve prepared. Not just questions, but penetrating questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What&rsquo;s your mentoring process?</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think you should improve your weaknesses. You should hire to your weaknesses. You should double-down on your strengths.</p>
<p>If you look at really successful people, they didn&rsquo;t become successful by being good at everything. They became successful because they were superb at something. They were able to work with people who were good at the other things.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pedigree?</li>
</ul>
<p>They (Google) learned from the data that that doesn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p>I look for proxies for judgement. What&rsquo;s judgement? It&rsquo;s decision-making under uncertainty. Anyone can make decisions if they have all the data. The most impactful decisions in a business are usually the ones that are made under uncertainty.</p>
<p>I ask for situations where there was lots of uncertainty, and ask what were the outcomes? A great example/proxy: what companies did you choose to work for. What I find is, people who work for a very successful company come to understand the keys to success and they look for that in their next employer. Someone who&rsquo;s worked for two unsuccessful companies has no idea what to look for and they generally, as a result, make a decision based only on compensation, which only dooms them to fail again.</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are you quick to cut something?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a really big devotee of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clayton_Christensen">Clay Christensen</a>, the Harvard Business School professor who really developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation">disruption theory</a>.</p>
<p>He coined a term in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator's_Dilemma">The Innovator&rsquo;s Dilemma</a> that I just love which is &ldquo;Fail fast and cheap.&rdquo; My great passion is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit">product-market fit</a>. I&rsquo;m the guy who coined the term and taught a course on it for 13 years at Stanford.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t find product-market fit immediately, you don&rsquo;t change the product, you change the market. You iterate on the market, you don&rsquo;t iterate on the product. If you don&rsquo;t get traction immediately in a market, you fail fast and cheap, and you try a different market. If after you try try 2 or 3 markets, and they don&rsquo;t work, then you cut bait.</p>
<ul>
<li>How to go after something novel?</li>
</ul>
<p>We&rsquo;ve tried to codiy that. I&rsquo;m a big believer in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">lean startup methodology</a>, where you develop, test, and prove a value hypothesis and only then do you test the growth hypothesis. The value hypothesis is the What, the Who, and the How. What are you going to build? For whom is it relevant? And, what&rsquo;s the business model? One of the biggest mistakes that people make (and I think this is really promoted by Y Combinator) is that you first prove growth to get money. And, I think this is horrible, because it&rsquo;s like building a house on a shaky foundation.</p>
<p>You can game growth. I think the only growth that matters in the beginning is organic growth. You can only get organic growth through word-of-mouth. You can only get word-of-mouth if you truly delighted your customers and found product-market fit.</p>
<p>In other words, product-market fit is just a fancy way of saying you&rsquo;ve proven your value proposition. And, how do you know you&rsquo;ve proven it? In a consumer company, it&rsquo;s exponential organic growth. If we don&rsquo;t achieve exponential organic growth right away, we iterate on the market.</p>
<p>Building more features doesn&rsquo;t ever get you more fit. That&rsquo;s the mistake that enterpreneurs continuously make. Removing features sometimes gets you the fit.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.wealthfront.com/">Wealthfront</a></li>
</ul>
<p>People think what we do is actually fancier than what we actually do. What we&rsquo;ve basically done is take best practices, used by the best financial advisors, and implemented them in software. We can radically lower the minimum account size and lower the fee.</p>
<p>By the way, 95% of the people who say they offer robo-advisors, all they do is provide diversified and low-cost index funds. That&rsquo;s what we did when we started in November of 2011. Back then, I used to say &ldquo;we add very little value and price accordingly.&rdquo; Since then, we&rsquo;ve added quite a bit of capability, automating best practices (e.g. tax-loss harvesting).</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been doing tax-loss harvesting since the end of 2012. The average pre-tax benefit of that is about 5% of your portfolio value per year. If your tax-rate is 40%, that means we save you 2% of your portfolio value per year. That&rsquo;s 8x what we charge as a fee.</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you determine when to harvest?</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s generally a one standard deviation loss. We&rsquo;ve backtested this many times. We recruited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burton_Malkiel">Burt Malkiel</a>, emeritus professor at Princeton, who actually invented the index fund when he wrote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Random_Walk_Down_Wall_Street">A Random Walk Down Wall Street</a>. He said &ldquo;you&rsquo;re missing an opportunity here. You&rsquo;re harvesting among index funds. Why not harvest within an index fund?&rdquo; That adds another 0.2% after-tax approximately for most people every year. That pays for our fee again 1x over.</p>
<ul>
<li>Average time to recover from a market correction, where it trades down by 10%?</li>
</ul>
<p>4 months.</p>
<p>How about a bear market, where it trades down 20%?</p>
<p>1 year and a half.</p>
<p>If you leave your money invested, it&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re going to make 20% over a year and a half. That&rsquo;s a hell of a return, rather than trying to time it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Holdings in Wealthfront?</li>
</ul>
<p>Our mission: Build a financial system that favors people not institutions.</p>
<p>We want to make money with our clients, not from our clients.</p>
