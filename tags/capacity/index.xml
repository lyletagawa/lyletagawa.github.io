      <description>Team Topologies provides four fundamental team types &amp;ndash; stream-aligned, platform, enabling, and complicated-subsystem &amp;ndash; and three core team interaction modes &amp;ndash; collaboration, X-as-a-Service, and facilitating. Together with awareness of Conway&amp;rsquo;s law, team cognitive load, and how to become a sensing organization, Team Topologies results in an effective and humanistic approach to building and running software systems.</description>
