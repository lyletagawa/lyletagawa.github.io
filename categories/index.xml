 In 1965, psychology researcher Bruce Tuckman published Tuckman’s stages of group development. These are the four stages a group goes through as it evolves from a bunch of strangers to a unified collective with common goals:
 Forming is when the group comes together in its new state. Your team might have a name, and probably has some understanding of its goal, but it’s likely that other processes or patterns still need to be defined or updated.</description>

      <description>Teams as the means of delivery The problem with org charts people don’t restrict their communications only to those connected lines on the [org] chart. We reach out to whomever we depend on to get work done. We bend the rules when required to achieve our goals. org charts don’t help us understand the actual patterns of communication in our organization
Systems thinking focuses on optimizing for the whole, looking at the overall flow of work, identifying what the largest bottleneck is today, and eliminating it.</description>

 ToC is a way to identify the most important limiting factor (the constraint) that stands in the way of achieving a goal and then systematically improving that constratint until it is no longer the limiting factor.</description>

Resilience vs Robustness Robustness refers to systems that are designed to effectively handle known failure modes
Resilience refers to systems that can handle failures that were not foreseeable by the designer
You can think of robustness as being able to deal well with known unknowns, and resilience as being able to deal well with unknown unknowns.
Resilience and Safety  Vacations are planned outages

Remote-First vs Remote-Friendly Remote-first workplaces claim to have a business advantage over remote-friendly workplaces.
Goals:
 Define the advantages (and disadvantages) of remote-first workplaces Highlight how an organization can benefit (from those advantages) Support claims with research and survey results  Why?  There’s no halfsies in a distributed team. If even one person on the team is remote, every single person has to start communicating online</description>

      <description>Turn the Ship Around! by L. David Marquet
First, though I liked the idea of empowerment, I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand why empowerment was needed.
Second, the way I was told to manage others was not the way I wanted to be managed.
Third, I was disturbed by the close coupling of the technical competence of the leader with the performance of the organization.
One of the things that limit our learning is our belief that we already know something.</description>

      <description>The Dip by Seth Godin
If it is worth doing, there is probably a Dip
Stick with the Dips that are likely to pan out, and quit the Cul-de-Sacs to focus your resources. That&amp;rsquo;s it
The Dip is the difference between the easy &amp;ldquo;beginner&amp;rdquo; technique and the more useful &amp;ldquo;expert&amp;rdquo; approach
The Dip creates scarcity; scarcity creates value
Never quit when panicked.

It is important to have when something goes wrong in your organization. There are basically two ways:
A retributive just culture asks:
 Which rule is broken? Who did it? How bad was the breach, and what should the consequences be? Who gets to decide this?  A restorative just culture asks:
 Who is hurt?</description>
