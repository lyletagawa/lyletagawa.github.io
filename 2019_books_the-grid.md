## The Grid by Gretchen Bakke

More than 70 percent of the grid's transmission lines and transformers
are twenty-five years old; add nine years to that and you have the average
age of an American power plant. According to the industry expert
Peter Asmus, we rely on twice as many power plants as we actually need
because of "the massive inefficiencies built into this system." As a result,
significant power outages are climbing year by year, from 15 in 2001 to
78 in 2007 to 307 in 2011. America has the highest number of outage
minutes of any developed nation -- coming in at about six hours per year,
not including blackouts caused by extreme weather or other "acts of
God," of which there were 679 between 2003 and 2012. Compare this
with Korea at 16 outage minutes a year, Italy at 51 minutes, Germany at
15, and Japan at 11. Not only do we have more outages than most other
industrial countries, but ours are getting longer. The average U.S. power
outage is 120 minutes and growing, while in the rest of the industrialized
world it's less than ten minutes and shrinking. According to Massoud
Amin, a power systems engineer, on "any given day in the U.S. about half
a million people are without power for two or more hours."
